      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Sel roti is a traditional Nepalese sweet bread that is typically made
        from rice flour, sugar, and water. The dough is shaped into a ring and
        then deep-fried until golden brown. Sel roti is commonly consumed during
        festivals like Dashain, Tihar and special occasions, but can also be
        found year-round in Nepalese markets and restaurants.

      <h2>Nutritional Value</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to nutritional value, sel roti is relatively high in
        calories and carbohydrates. A 100-gram serving of sel roti contains
        approximately 300 calories and 60 grams of carbohydrates. It is also a
        good source of iron and magnesium. However, sel roti is also high in fat
        and sugar, with about 15 grams of fat and 15 grams of sugar per serving.

        <ul>
          <li>Rice Flour</li>
          <li>Sugar</li>
          <li>Butter</li>
          <li>Sunflower Oil</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Another way to make sel roti healthier is by using alternative
        ingredients such as millet, oat, and corn flour, which are rich in
        nutrients and lower in calories. These alternatives provide more dietary
        fiber, vitamins, and minerals than traditional rice flour. They also
        have a lower glycemic index, which can help keep blood sugar levels
        stable.
