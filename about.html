      <p> My name is Samiksha. I enjoy exploring new places. I am originally from Palpa and currently living in Kathmandu Nepal. I am MBA graduate from Uniglobe College under Pokhara University. I love to work in accounting and finance field as well as I have keen interest in learning coding and web page design.
