      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
      Sel roti is a traditional Nepalese sweet bread that is typically made from rice flour, sugar, and water. The dough is shaped into a ring and then deep-fried until golden brown. Sel roti is commonly consumed during festivals like Dashain, Tihar and special occasions, but can also be found year-round in Nepalese markets and restaurants.

      <h2>Nutritional Value</h2>
      <p>
      When it comes to nutritional value, sel roti is relatively high in calories and carbohydrates. A 100-gram serving of sel roti contains approximately 300 calories and 60 grams of carbohydrates. It is also a good source of iron and magnesium. However, sel roti is also high in fat and sugar, with about 15 grams of fat and 15 grams of sugar per serving.

     <P>
      Another way to make sel roti healthier is by using alternative ingredients such as millet, oat, and corn flour, which are rich in nutrients and lower in calories. These alternatives provide more dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals than traditional rice flour. They also have a lower glycemic index, which can help keep blood sugar levels stable.
